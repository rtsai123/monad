    //
    //   - we execute proposed block B1
    //
    //   - execution begins to fall behind, while consensus advances; B1
    //     receives a QC (upon the proposal of B2) and B2 also received a QC
    //     (upon proposal of B3), finalizing B1; the execution daemon is still
    //     working on B1 during this time (or more likely, is restarting after
    //     a crash that occurs immediately after B1 has executed)
    //
    //   - by the time execution is ready to execute another proposed block,
    //     consensus has finalized B1; this is communicated to the execution
    //     daemon, and finalize logic takes precedence and runs immediately,
    //     emitting a BLOCK_FINALIZED event
    //
    //   - during the execution of B2, we'll see the QC for B1. Since it has
    //     already been finalized, we'll skip it
